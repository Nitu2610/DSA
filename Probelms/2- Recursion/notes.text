Recursion- when a funciton call's itself until a specific condition is met. 
when a funciton call's itself- a function-A  inside another function B.

In Call Stack the flow is First In Last Out.

Example:- 
let sum = 0;
function A() {
  sum++;
  console.log(sum);
  if (sum == 10) {  // specific conition is checked
    return;
  }
  return A(); // fn is called
}

A();
