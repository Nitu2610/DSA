📌 Pattern Problems (Star Patterns)

All pattern problems use nested loops.

Outer loop → controls the number of lines (rows).

Inner loop → controls the number of columns and is usually related to the row number.

Print "*" (or required symbol) inside the inner loop.

Always observe symmetry in the pattern.


🔁 Recursion

Recursion: When a function calls itself until a base condition is met.

The function keeps calling itself and stops when the base condition is satisfied.

In the call stack, execution follows FILO (First In, Last Out).

A Recursion Tree is a diagram used to visualize recursive calls.
